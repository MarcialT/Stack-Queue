WELCOME TO THE QUEUE & STACK CODE

1. Create a program that reverses the order of a stack by saving the data with the inverted order 
within the same stack.

2. Perform a program that processes the data (Do something with it, print, play, etc.) 
from a normal queue in order of priority (Do not use priority queues). 
Example: TAIL: start - > (B, "Daniel") - (C, "Pablo") - (D, "Coraline") - (A, "Alfonzo") - (C, "Lara") - (A, "Paula ") - (A," Chancho ") - (A," Light ")> 
Process A first, then B, then C and D 

3. Create a template for a priority queue using simple linked lists, instead of 
arrangements as in practice.
